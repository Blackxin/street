Aerobics takes more endurance than anaerobics because it goes on for much longer while anaerobics are done in quick bursts of intense energy. A process called cellular metabolism is conducted by the biological cell. 2.aerobic exercise involves moderate rate and anaerobic requires a fast pace high intensity. 1 while some exercises may predominantly fit into one category, many activities will be associated with more than one.
