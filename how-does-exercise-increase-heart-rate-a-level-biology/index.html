• describe how the ‘pulse’ rate can be measured and interpreted. Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. While you are running, blood flow is diverted toward tissues that need it most. When exercising our muscles contract more often and require more energy.

<p>Exercise causes an increase in pulse rate (heart rate). Following exercise, the heart continues to beat faster for a while to ensure that all excess waste products are removed from muscle cells. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. It is also likely that muscle cells have been respiring anaerobically during exercise and so have built up an oxygen debt. 53 Summary of Smoking Biology Notes for A level.</p>

<p>This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete. During exercise there is an increase in physical activity and muscle cells respire more than they do when the body is at rest. For example, muscles in the arteries in your legs relax to allow more blood flow. This experiment was geared towards determining the pulse rate, heart rate, blood pressure level and the breathing rate of a student, during and after strenuous exercise activities.

<h3 id="how-does-exercise-affect-heart-rate">How Does Exercise Affect Heart Rate.</h3><p>It causes the heart rate to increase. A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. During exercise the cardiac output is greatly increased. For example, muscles in the arteries in your legs relax to allow more blood flow.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-high-output-during-exercise">Benefits Of High Output During Exercise:</h3><p>Cardiac output = stoke volume x heart rate • when anybody exercises, their cardiac output will increase because. Again, the stretch receptors in the muscles give a more rapid indication of muscular activity, allowing an anticipatory increase in breathing rate even before the carbon dioxide concentration the blood has. This causes the san to increase its rate of fire, increasing the heart rate. During exercise, the heart must beat faster to eliminate excess carbon dioxide and increase the supply of oxygen in the body.</p>
