<p>Cellular respiration is a series of metabolic reactions that occur within the cells of organisms (both plants and animals) to convert biochemical energy derived from nutrients to adenosine triphosphate (atp) and then release waste products. Cellular respiration is a process in which cells take apart food molecules and use their atoms as a source of energy. Processes that take place in the cells and tissues during which energy is released and carbon dioxide is produced and absorbed by the blood to be transported to the lungs.

<p>The procedure for metabolizing protein occurs in much the identical way. In order for an animal’s body to convert its food to energy through cellular respiration, oxygen is needed. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body. Cellular respiration provides energy to body cells through a process of sugar burning. 3 Steps of Cellular Respiration Microbial Facts.</p>
