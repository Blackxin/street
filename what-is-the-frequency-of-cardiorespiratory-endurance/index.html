<p>What is the frequency and time needed to improve cardiorespiratory endurance? As one of the four primary components of physical fitness, it is an important measure of the overall health and fitness. Stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise. Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance means that you will increase your physical shape, and therefore be able to exercise for longer periods and at a higher intensity level, without getting tired.</p>
