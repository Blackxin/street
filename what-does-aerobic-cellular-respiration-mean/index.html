However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Aerobic, or respiration in the presence of oxygen, and anaerobic.

<p>We need it for life because, in our soma cells, it liberates the chemical energy we use for our life function. Aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration are two different processes that allow cells to convert energy from food into a form that they can use. This type of respiration is common in most of the plants and animals, birds, humans, and other mammals. Aerobic cellular respiration uses oxygen and yields many more atp molecules than anaerobic cellular respiration, which does not use oxygen and yields only two atp molecules.
