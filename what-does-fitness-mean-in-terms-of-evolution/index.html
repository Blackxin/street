<p>Evolutionary fitness is how well a species is able to survive and reproduce in its environment. The term ” fitness ” in evolutionary biology means the ability of an organism to pass on its genetic material to its offspring. Certain traits will have been lost from the gene pool forever. Officially, fitness is defined as the average number of children that organisms with a certain genotype or phenotype leave behind in comparison to the number of offspring left behind by other organisms in the community.</p>

<p>Evolution does not occur in individuals, it can only occur. So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring than green beetles because of their color, you’d say that the brown beetles had a higher fitness. Charles darwin outlined the mechanisms of how species change, by natural selection and sexual selection. Evolutionary biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to other genotypes.
