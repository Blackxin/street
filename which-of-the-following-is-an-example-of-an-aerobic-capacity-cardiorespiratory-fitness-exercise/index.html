THE EVIDENCE FOR EXERCISE Combine Aerobic Exercise with Strength From allyogapositions.com
Aerobic exercise is any type of cardiovascular conditioning, or “cardio.”. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Cardiorespiratory endurance is defined as “the ability to perform large muscle, dynamic exercise for prolonged periods”. It reflects the ability to function effectively in normal daily activity and can be assessed with field tests such as the pacer or walking test.
