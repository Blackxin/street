Average resting heart rate by age: Your heart rate rises and your pulse quickens, showing that your cardiovascular system is active. All of these can improve your heart recovery rate. As the american heart association (aha) notes, for most people who are sitting or lying down — calm, relaxed and not ill — a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) is normal.

<p>In all of these circumstances, the heart rate increase is a normal response. For adults, a ‘normal’ rhr ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, although most people who are relaxed and healthy should be below 90. As the amount of blood increased, the heart rate also increased to meet the demand for nutrients and oxygen. Your heart rate should increase as your body’s demand for oxygen rises during exercise — but not everyone’s heart responds the same.</p>
