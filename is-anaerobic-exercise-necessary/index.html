<p>Any activity performed at a high enough intensity that your body can’t provide the necessary energy to complete it with oxygen intake alone. Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. This is due to the fact that it reduces the sarcopenia with the passage of time. This could be bars, dumbbells, machines, etc. What Is the Importance of Anaerobic Exercise? Healthy Living.</p>
