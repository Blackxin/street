<p>It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Letâs discuss the anaerobic respiration examples briefly. Anaerobic respiration is a process of cellular respiration where the high energy electron acceptor is neither oxygen nor pyruvate derivatives. Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules. Aerobic &amp; anaerobic respiration explained Teaching Resources.</p>
