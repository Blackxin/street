Overview of Cellular Respiration Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Respiration From byjus.com
Carbon dioxide is typically seen as a waste product that must be eliminated. In addition to aerobic respiration, there is also anaerobic respiration, which is the conversion of sugars into energy in environments where oxygen isn’t present. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. | physiology | biology | fuseschoolrespiration is the chemical process that supplies the body with energy for all other life pro.

<p>What changes happen to your body when you exercise and how does this link to respiration? Two types of cellular respiration exist: Aerobic respiration is the process through which glucose is burned or oxidised in the presence of oxygen to produce energy. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that seem to directly oppose each other. Cellular Respiration ALevel Biology Revision Notes.</p>
