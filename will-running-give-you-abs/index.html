Can Running Give You Abs In No Time? It&#39;s Not What You Think! From goaheadrunner.com
Although high intensity explosive sprint training will contribute to building muscle tone in the abs, running alone will not give you stronger abs. Try to run at intervals, as this boosts your metabolism for a long period. If your purpose behind running is because you plan to some time or another have the stomach of an olympic runner, running alone won’t get you there. Running uphill burns more calories so, therefore, helps you lean down to 14% body fat and allow your abs to show.
