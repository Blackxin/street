<p>The third and final energy system which comes into play is the oxidative system, commonly known as the aerobic energy system. This energy system can be developed with various types of training. In aerobic exercise, oxygen is used to create a metabolic reaction in your cells. The aerobic system uses aerobic glycolysis, the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain in its production of atp. Aerobic system.</p>

<p>The by products of this process are water (in sweat) carbon dioxide (in breath) and heat (produced by the muscles). The more atp produced, the more energy is available. This energy system relies on dietary carbohydrates to supply glucose and glycogen (stored glucose) to create atp through a process called glycolysis. Since the aerobic energy system is very efficient at storing and utilizing this energy. Aerobic and anaerobic training.</p>

Often referred to as the âenergy currencyâ of biology, this molecule allows cells to turn energy into work. However, when the intensity increases and the demands on the body change, the body must use other methods. The work periods would usually exceed several minutes and the rest periods would be active but at a lower intensity that could be sustained.</p>
