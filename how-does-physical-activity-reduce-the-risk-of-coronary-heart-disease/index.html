Physical activity associated with reduced risk of coronary heart From healthyageinc.wordpress.com
It also helps reduce your risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, many types of cancer, depression and anxiety, and dementia. Recent reports document a large national health burden of chronic disease with significant proportions due to behavioral dimensions such as physical inactivity and low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. There is sufficient evidence to justify the inclusion of regular exercise in efforts to reduce overall coronary heart disease (chd) morbidity and mortality. In addition, regular exercise reduces myocardial oxygen demand and increases exercise capacity, translating into reduced coronary risk.
