It is through a combination of practice, dedication, and patience that only then will you slowly begin to benefit from it. You’re putting your whole heart and soul into the fitness regimen, going to the gym five days each week. The first two to three weeks there’s generally a lot of soreness for a few days after a workout. A beginner can see as much as 2 ½ pounds of muscle gain per month.
