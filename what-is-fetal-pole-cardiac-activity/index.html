In an early pregnancy ultrasound, if the embryo isn&#39;t far enough along to have developed into a recognizable fetus, the ultrasound tech will look to identify a fetal pole. Seeing your baby&#39;s heartbeat on an early pregnancy ultrasound is one of the surest indicators that a pregnancy is proceeding as it should. Here’s a diagram from moore. The goal of debunking the fetal heartbeat and replacing it with sterile “cardiac activity” is obvious:
