<p>The main purpose of respiration is to provide oxygen to the cells at a rate adequate to satisfy their metabolic needs. The electron transport chain is made up of four groups of proteins on the inner membrane. Within the human body, both aerobic and anaerobic respiration are important to muscle function. Respiration provides cells with oxygen and expels toxic carbon dioxide. List of Important Biological Phenomena.</p>

<p>Aerobic respiration produces far more atp, but risks exposure to oxygen toxicity. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. This involves transport of oxygen from the lung to the tissues by means of the circulation of blood. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration.
