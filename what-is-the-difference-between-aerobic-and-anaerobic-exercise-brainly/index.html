<p>Aerobic exercise is exercise with air anaerobic exercise is an exercise without air. The main difference between aerobic excercise and anaerobic excercise is that aerobic exercises require the presence of a lot of oxygen to fuel up the muscles, whereas anaerobic exercises do not require the presence of much oxygen to fuel up the muscles. As we can see, the main differences between aerobic and anaerobic exercises are duration, intensity, and above all, energy spent. Whereas, for anaerobic exercise, the muscles depend on other alternate sources of energy.</p>
