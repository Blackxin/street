Cellular Respiration Definition Easy to Understand From gamesmartz.com
Organisms that do not depend on oxygen degrade foodstuffs in a process called fermentation. Oxidation of pyruvate is the second step of aerobic respiration occurring, representing one. This process is crucial to life because it produces adenosine triphosphate, or atp, the. (adenosine triphosphate) chemical found in most living cells and used for energy.
