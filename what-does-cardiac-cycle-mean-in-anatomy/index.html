<p>The cardiac cycle describes all the activities of the heart through one complete heartbeat—that is, through one contraction and relaxation of both the atria and ventricles. Duration of cardiac cycle depends on the heart rate per minute. A contraction event (of either the atria or ventricles) is referred to as systole, and a relaxation event is referred to as diastole. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next. Cardiovascular System I Heart Pediatric nurse practitioner.</p>

Period of time between the onset of atrial contraction (atrial systole) and ventricular relaxation (ventricular diastole) diastole. The period of time that begins with contraction of the atria and ends with ventricular relaxation is known as the cardiac cycle ().the period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole.the period of relaxation that occurs as the chambers fill with blood is called diastole.both the atria and ventricles undergo systole and diastole, and it is.

<p>The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole. A contraction event (of either the atria or ventricles) is referred to as systole, and a relaxation event is referred to as diastole. Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart.

<p>The process begins as early as the 4th gestational week when the heart first begins contracting. The heart is a complex organ that pumps blood through the body with an intricate system of muscle layers, chambers, valves and nodes. The cardiac cycle can be divided into four stages:. Medical definition of cardiac cycle. Normal Heart Function and Normal Heart Rhythm.</p>
<h3 id="these-two-phases-are-subdivided-into-seven-phases">These Two Phases Are Subdivided Into Seven Phases.</h3><p>A contraction event (of either the atria or ventricles) is referred to as systole, and a relaxation event is referred to as diastole. The heart’s primary function is to circulate blood throughout the body in a cycle.every day, the human heart beats around 100,000 times. The cardiovascular system involves systemic and pulmonary circulation and is responsible for the transport of various substances in human beings, and is composed of the heart, arteries, veins, and blood capillaries. That is when the aortic valve and pulmonary artery closes and atrioventricular valves open, thus causing chambers of the heart to relax.</p>
<h3 id="following-are-the-different-phases-that-occur-in-a-cardiac-cycle">Following Are The Different Phases That Occur In A Cardiac Cycle:</h3><p>Period of time when the heart muscle is relaxed and the chambers fill with blood. During the entire cycle, pressure is maintained…. There is an inverse relationship between the duration of cardiac cycle and heart rate. The cardiac cycle is the performance of the human heart from the beginning of one heartbeat to the beginning of the next.</p>
<h3 id="duration-of-cardiac-cycle-depends-on-the-heart-rate-per-minute">Duration Of Cardiac Cycle Depends On The Heart Rate Per Minute.</h3><p>The complete sequence of events in the heart from the beginning of one beat to the beginning of the following beat : Filling period—the inlet valve is opened to fill the ventricle and the outlet valve is closed. It consists of two periods: It has its own circulation system and receives electric impulses that make it contract and relax, which triggers a sequence of events forming the cardiac cycle.</p>
<h3 id="the-cardiac-cycle-can-be-divided-into-four-stages">The Cardiac Cycle Can Be Divided Into Four Stages:.</h3><p>The cardiac cycle is continuous. The period of contraction that the heart undergoes while it pumps blood into circulation is called systole. The first article in this section regards the cardiac cycle in overview.
