Grab the other half and do the same. To lose belly fat by drinking water, drink between 9 and 13 cups of water a day, which will help you feel fuller throughout the day so you don’t eat as much. Belly fat and weight gain are mostly affected by how many calories you take in during the day, how many calories you burn during the day, and how old you are. If you normally consume two cans of cola per day, substituting plain or sparkling water can spare you about 270 calories daily.
