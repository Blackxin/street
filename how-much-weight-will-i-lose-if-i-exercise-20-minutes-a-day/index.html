How Much Water To Drink In A Day To Lose Weight? From stylecraze.com
Extreme weight loss diets can definitely work, but only for a short period of time. I believe you will definitely lose weight but i am not too sure if you were able to maintain this way or maintain the weight you lose after you stop doing it. Exercise alone often doesn&#39;t cause significant weight loss because it can increase appetite, causing you to eat back the calories you just burned. I also question if the weight you will lose would be equal amount of muscle and fat.
