That is the maximum rate your heart should beat while exercising. When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it. At a 50 percent exertion level, your target would be 50 percent of that maximum, or 85 beats per minute. While this isn’t a perfect method, it.

To determine your target heart rate, subtract your age from 220. This condition can cause your heart to beat between 160 and 220 times a minute.
