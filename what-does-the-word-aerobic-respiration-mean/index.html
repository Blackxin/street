What molecule does aerobic respiration use that anaerobic respiration From proprofs.com
Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received. Glucose is known as a respiratory substrate, and is broken down by cells to produce energy in the form of atp. In this process, water and carbon dioxide are produced as end products. The process by which mitochondria use to transfer the energy in foods to atp is known as cellular respiration.
