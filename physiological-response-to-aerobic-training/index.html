<meta name="description" content="20 Min Physiological Response To Aerobic Training With ABS, Aerobic endurance training typically will lead to a blunted response in hormone release at the same absolute level of submax exercise. These adaptations profoundly impact the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems (the two most affected organ systems), enabling more efficient oxygen delivery, endurance capacity, and improved performance.
Physiological adaptations in response to aerobic training From slideshare.net
The bones become stressed during exercise when the tendons and muscles pull. Resting hr decreases with aerobic training and is lower at any given workload. However, individual response to an aerobic training program can vary. Effective aerobic exercise has been shown to elicit adaptations at both the molecular and macroscopic levels.

<p>An acute physiological response refers to an immediate response of one or more of the bodies systems to exercise, such as the heart rate increasing as a gym member sits on the bike and starts their warm up. Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. The five major immediate physiological responses to training include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, ventilation and lactate levels.

<p>These responses are directly proportional to the intensity, duration, frequency. Figure 9.2 summarizes the main physiological changes that underlie an improvement in o 2max. •the sns response includes generalized peripheral vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles and increased myocardial contractility, an increased heart rate, and an increased systolic blood pressure. Virtually all tissues in the human body rely on aerobic metabolism for energy production and are therefore critically dependent on continuous supply of oxygen.

The expectancy of an effect of fitness on the physiological stress response is based on the assumption that this response resembles the response to exercise. Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. The five major immediate physiological responses to training include heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, ventilation and lactate levels.</p>

Resting hr decreases with aerobic training and is lower at any given workload. This increase in demand forces the body to instantaneously make adjustments to the working systems and eventually adapt.
