Aerobics What Is Aerobic Exercise? Definition, Benefits &amp; Examples From aerobicse.blogspot.com
The simplest of all aerobic exercises does not involve walking at a slow pace, but walking steadily and at a brisk pace for at least half an hour. Cardiovascular endurance is the heart&#39;s ability to withstand extended periods of activity. Aerobic capacity is the endurance of activity on the heart muscle in high or low impact aerobic exercise. This can be contrasted with anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting that uses massive amounts of oxygen in a short time such that it can’t be sustained for long.
