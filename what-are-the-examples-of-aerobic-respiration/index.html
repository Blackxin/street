Oxygen is absent when this form of respiration takes place. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes.

<p>Aerobic respiration in bacteria involves the same three multistep processes (glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain) as all other aerobic organisms. Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy for use by the organism which gets stored in the atp molecules.

<p>Aerobic respiration means the use of air and in technical terms it is using oxygen.breathing by most living organisms which is followed by krebs cycle as part of atp generation by the cells is an example of aerobic respiration. However, it is a quicker process and produces essential intermediate products like ethanol and organic acids. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. Same as aerobic respiration, glucose molecules undergo a glycolysis process and convert into pyruvate.
