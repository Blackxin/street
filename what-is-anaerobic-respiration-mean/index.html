<p>The reactions fall into two stages: Anaerobic respiration is the metabolic process in which oxygen is absent, and only the stage of glycolysis is completed. The biogeochemical cycling of these compounds, which depends upon anaerobic respiration, significantly impacts the carbon cycle and global warming. Glycolysis, in which glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvic acid (pyruvate) in the general cell cytoplasm. Respiration &amp; gas exchange.</p>
