physical fitness meaning definition From zacsfitness.blogspot.com
Physical fitness means the capacity to do the routine work without any fatigue or exertion and after doing the work the person has power to do some more work and recovery is quicker. It covers a good diet, a mix of strength, flexibility and endurance, certainly covers good sleeping patterns and the mental aspect too. When i ask someone what “being fit” or what fitness means to them, most people will talk about only physical health. “the quality or state of being fit.” wow, that seems broad.
