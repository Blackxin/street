Aerobic vs Anaerobic Exercise Difference Between From pewilusacixi.tsuki-infini.com
This is the biggest reason anaerobic capacity is important; Aerobic, means with oxygen, therefore while you’re training in an aerobic state, your body has a sufficient amount of oxygen to provide the energy which is necessary to sustain an exercise for a prolonged period of time, without tapping into other energy. Adding either cardio/aerobic and anaerobic exercise to your weight loss routine will increase your weight loss potential. The golden question… and it basically comes down to this picture:
