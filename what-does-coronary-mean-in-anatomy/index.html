<p>The coronary system is comprised of arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and cardiac veins and venules. The left coronary artery and its branches play a crucial role in ensuring that the muscles of the heart, itself, are supplied with oxygenated blood. The rca supplies blood to your right atrium and right ventricle (where deoxygenated blood goes before heading to the lungs). The primary task of the right coronary artery is to ensure proper circulation to the myocardium—the muscles of the heart—and, as such, influences the overall functioning of the body.</p>
