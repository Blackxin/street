<p>B) respiration through root hair : The root hair is present on root and at the tip of root.the water stream is present in the soil between rocks from where water is absorbed by plant with the help of root.the air space is present between rocks.the root hair get oxygen from the air space present in between. The respiration process in all living beings must be conducted fluently. Rate of respiration is comparatively faster. Part 5 Plant Metabolism—Respiration dōTERRA Essential Oils.</p>

<p>Thus respiration is essentially a process of biological oxidation in which oxygen absorbed from the air breaks down the food (sugar) into carbon dioxide and water, thereby releasing. It can be represented by an equation as: Plant respiration diagram and definition. The word respiration is derived from the latin word ‘respirare’ (literally means to breathe).

<p>Just like humans, a marijuana plant has to breathe: Meaning of respiration in plants: Respiratory organs in the plants are stomata in leaves, lenticels and surface of roots. We know that during photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, and is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as glucose and starch.

The process of respiration in plants involves using the sugars produced during photosynthesis plus oxygen to produce. The process of respiration in plants involves using the sugars produced during photosynthesis plus oxygen to produce energy for plant growth. 1) it releases energy, which is consumed in various metabolic processes necessary for life of plant.</p>
