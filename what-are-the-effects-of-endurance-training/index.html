The Effects of Resistance Training vs Endurance Training on Muscle From sbyireview.com
The less we focus on strength and power, the more stress we put on our joints and bones. These improvements allow the body to have the oxygen needed to oxidize glycogen and fat. Central cardiovascular adaptations include decreased heart rate, increased stroke volume of the heart, increased blood plasma, without any major changes in red blood cell count, which reduces blood viscosity and increased cardiac output as. Any exercise can be beneficial for your heart, but research indicates that endurance exercise is particularly.
