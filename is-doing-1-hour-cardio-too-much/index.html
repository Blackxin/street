My FULL Workout Routine (Is 2 Hours Too Much?) Online Fitness Gym From onlinefitnessgym.com
An hour of resistance training would burn about 365 calories for a person this size, as well as helping build muscle. Sixty minutes of challenging aerobics is too much if it’s done preceding or following a strength training workout. A lot of people think that if you starve yourself and do two or three hours of cardio each day, the fat is just going to melt off. The goal of any type of working out, whether it be cardio, strength training, or stretching is to go harder than last time.
