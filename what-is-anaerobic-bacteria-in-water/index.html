<p>Anaerobic septic systems use bacteria that can live without oxygen. A consortium of anaerobic bacteria are used in waste water treatment with organic materials causing high bod (should be more than 5000 ppm) which is not feasible to treat by aerobic bacteria.

<p>In the bioreactor, the microorganisms digest the organic matter in the wastewater. Anaerobic digestion is a process through which bacteria break down organic matter—such as animal manure, wastewater biosolids, and food wastes—in the absence of oxygen.

<p>The anaerobic treatment of water is a basic biological process. This process is popular because it is able to stabilize the water with little biomass production. Anaerobic bacteria are fastidious, difficult to isolate, and often overlooked. During anaerobic wastewater treatment processes, microorganisms break down waste matter in the absence of oxygen.

<p>Anaerobic bacteria were widely present both in the sewage and in the air at workplaces from the wwtp, especially when the technological process was performed in closed spaces. The anaerobic wastewater treatment uses anaerobic bacteria that change organic matter into organisms that contain large quantities of methane gas and carbon dioxide. Not only do the bacteria remove contaminating compounds from the effluent. A consortium of anaerobic bacteria are used in waste water treatment with organic materials causing high bod (should be more than 5000 ppm) which is not feasible to treat by aerobic bacteria.

<p>The ammonia part of this reaction is produced when our fish poop, plants decay or excess fish food rots. This bioreactor holds a thick substance called sludge. Aerobic wastewater treatment is a process where bacteria utilize oxygen to degrade organic matter (generally quantified as biochemical oxygen demand or bod) and other pollutants involved in various production systems. A limited range of strains that are very strict and aerotolerant, with some varieties growing under sediment. What is the difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria.</p>

<p>When the oxygen concentration in the water drops to zero, the nitrate(v) level also decreases. Anaerobic digestion for biogas production takes place in a sealed vessel called a reactor, which is designed and constructed in various shapes and sizes specific to the site. The sludge contains anaerobic bacteria and other beneficial microbes. However, these organisms use oxygen found in the oxides introduced in the system or that which is present in the organic matter found in the wastewater, slurries, and sludge.
