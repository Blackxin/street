Vo 2 max is determined by the combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction in the tissues. Vo 2 max bp the maximum amount of physiological work that an individual can do, as measured by oxygen consumption. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Aerobic activities they do not need a great physical effort, the most important thing is the duration of each one of them.

<p>Aerobic activities they do not need a great physical effort, the most important thing is the duration of each one of them. Highest amount of oxygen a person can consume during maximal exercise of several minutes' duration. While there are a number of ways to measure aerobic capacity (more on this below), think of aerobic capacity as the volume of oxygen pumped through your body in a given amount of time. Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.v̇o 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity.
