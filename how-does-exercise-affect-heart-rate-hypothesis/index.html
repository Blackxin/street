‘’ during physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal. How does exercise affect heart rate? Compare heart rates of individuals at different activity levels; An athlete’s heart muscle has built up overtime and become stronger due to the constant exercise an athlete participates in.

<p>The purpose of this lab was to determine which level of exercise would have the greatest impact on affected pulse and blood. After exercise, how will it take for the person’s heart rate to return to normal? Develop a hypothesis about the effects of exercise on heart rate; When doing exercise, your body will function faster which means glucose and oxygen must be delivered to the organs faster.</p>

<p>When doing exercise, your body will function faster which means glucose and oxygen must be delivered to the organs faster. Methods 10 healthy male subjects were studied at rest, during static exercise performed at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction (sx30), and during dynamic cycling exercises done at 30% of v̇o2max (dx30) and at 60% of v̇o2max (dx60). Therefore, the heart muscle can pump more volume of blood per beat than a normal person. This means the heart beats fewer times per minute than it would in a nonathlete.
