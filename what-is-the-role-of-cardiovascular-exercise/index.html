They play an important role in the brain’s emotional response system. Heart rate is sometimes used as a measure of how much oxygen you are using in order to gauge exercise intensity. Cardiovascular exercise is defined as any aerobic activity pushing the heart from 55 to 85 percent of its maximum rate. Some may not realize the heart is the most important muscle in your body and controls oxygen to all other muscles.
