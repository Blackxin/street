Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that seem to directly oppose each other. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food.

<p>Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. This series of biochemical reactions is also called a âmetabolic pathway.â. This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.

<h3 id="as-already-stated-cellular-respiration-can-be-of-two-types">As Already Stated, Cellular Respiration Can Be Of Two Types:</h3><p>It is a process when glucose is broken down in the absence of oxygen. As its name suggested, aerobic respiration is cells breaking down sugar into energy and other waste with the presence of oxygen, or also known as what you are usually referring to when talking about cellular respiration. It eliminates carbon dioxide and water as waste products. Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen.</p>
<h3 id="aerobic-respiration-and-anaerobic-respiration">Aerobic Respiration And Anaerobic Respiration.</h3><p>'aero' means air, which contains oxygen, leading to the name aerobic respiration. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. Each process produces different amounts of energy and has different benefits and drawbacks. The carbon dioxide is a waste product of aerobic respiration because cells do not need it.</p>
<h3 id="cellular-respiration-is-the-process-through-which-the-biochemical-energy-converts-into-the-energy-in-atp">Cellular Respiration Is The Process Through Which The Biochemical Energy Converts Into The Energy In Atp.</h3><p>Interestingly, the bacteria that produce acetic acid use ethyl alcohol as their fuel. We need it for life because, in our soma cells, it liberates the chemical energy we use for our life function. It is a colorless, odorless gas that, in the molecular form of o2, composes one fifth of the air we breathe. In this process, a food molecule breaks down.</p>

However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both. Aerobic and anaerobic cellular respiration are two different processes that allow cells to convert energy from food into a form that they can use. It is the respiratory process where the electron is transferred to dioxygen molecules (o 2 ), generating water molecules and energy molecule atp.</p>
