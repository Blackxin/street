<p>Coronary artery disease (cad) coronary artery disease is caused by plaque buildup in the wall of the arteries that supply blood to the heart (called coronary arteries). An example is the gene variation that is found in factor v leiden disorder, a specific gene mutation that leads to an increased risk of blood clots. Plaque is made up of cholesterol deposits.
