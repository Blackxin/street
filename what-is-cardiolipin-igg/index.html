Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. There are two positive results that may also occur. As there are four distinct alkyl chains in cardiolipin, the potential for complexity of this molecule species is enormous. The antibodies are igg (immunoglobulin g), iga (immunoglobulin a), and igm (immunoglobulin m).
