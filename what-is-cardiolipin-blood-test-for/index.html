Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. They may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged aptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if. An cardiolipin antibodies test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood.
