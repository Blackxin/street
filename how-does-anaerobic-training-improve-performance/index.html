Anaerobic training increases anaerobic capacity through a number of different ways, including: This in turn results in a higher afterburn effect in metabolism, because muscle cells need and consume more energy than fat cells. Anaerobic training specifically develops the two anaerobic energy systems and often develops power, strength and speed in the process.

<p>The most commonly used test length has been 30. To achieve this, athletes need to increase the speed and explosiveness of their movements, which requires lowering the weights that they are working with. Both resistance training (anaerobic) and endurance training (aerobic) are excellent ways to improve fitness and burn calories.

Faster race times aren’t the only benefit of anaerobic training. If we take all these benefits together, one thing becomes clear: Physiological adaptations short duration interval training sessions of high intensity are used to develop the anaerobic system.</p>
