High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) W10 Personal Training Gym From w10.fit
Hiit is a training method where you work as hard as you can at the prescribed exercises during short intervals. These bursts can be short — just 30 seconds can make all the difference — or more substantial, up to 4 minutes. So, for example, you might run at just about full speed for ten seconds to one minute, and then jog or walk for 30 seconds all the way up to four minutes (more on ideal interval times and exercises later). Instead, it involves short, intense bursts of activity, interspaced with with rest periods.
