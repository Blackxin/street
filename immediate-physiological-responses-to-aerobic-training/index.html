<p>Core 2 body in motion. The first dash point for the immediate physiological responses to training is heart rate. An exercise such as running can be both aerobic and anaerobic, depending on the pace you keep up. This increase in demand forces the body to instantaneously make adjustments to the working systems and eventually adapt. Chapter 6.</p>
