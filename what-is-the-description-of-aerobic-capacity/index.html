<p>This in scientific terms is your aerobic capacity 1. Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.vÌo 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity. In the example above, an athlete recorded 100w as their maximum aerobic capacity. There are a number of online calculators that can help you gauge your aerobic capacity.
