<p>The fundamental difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the usage of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration. Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received.
