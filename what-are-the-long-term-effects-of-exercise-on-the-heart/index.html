<p>The intensity of physical activity determines how much the heart rate will increase. Chronic extreme exercise training and competing in endurance events can lead to heart damage and rhythm disorders. The extra work of pumping blood against the increased pressure causes the ventricle to thicken over time, the same way a body muscle increases in mass. The researchers said no harmful cardiovascular health effects were found for those who reported exercising more than four times the recommended levels, disputing previous studies that have found.
