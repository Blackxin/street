The number one aspect that intervals improve is aerobic capacity. “these more explosive type training sessions are also important for building muscle strength and developing my joints in a way that protects them and helps prevent injuries,” richardsson. In this case, speed is considered as the tip of the ice berg. Anaerobic training specifically develops the two anaerobic energy systems and often develops power, strength and speed in the process.

<p>More recent research also says that anaerobic training can improve the athlete’s aerobic endurance. Anaerobic training enhances the anaerobic metabolic capacity of the muscle fibres that are being trained, thus increasing the ability of the athlete to train, and therefore perform at higher exercise intensity (mcardle et.
