High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Type 2 Diabetes From diabetes.co.uk
Three minutes at 6 mph. High intensity interval training (hiit) has its roots right back in the 1950s with sprint coaches using it in on their sprint athletes with 100% hr intensities to yield quick adaptations to baseline fitness so they could spend more time on max velocity efforts. This technique is recommended for beginners and intermediate exercisers. The types of hiit can be broken down by exercise selection (you can do hiit on a treadmill, a bike.

<p>But scientists and doctors are now using superlatives to discuss what many consider to be one of the most important new fitness approaches in decades: “high intensity” is based on the individual’s perceived level of exertion. It incorporates several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80% of one’s maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements.
