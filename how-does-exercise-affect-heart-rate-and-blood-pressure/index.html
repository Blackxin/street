Compared with the usual care group, the exercisers lowered their systolic blood pressure (the first number in a reading) by an average of 7.1 points and their diastolic blood pressure (the second number) by 5.1 points. During exercise, the heart rate increases and blood pressure rises somewhat, but the blood vessels become more stretchy, which can. As a result, exercising has a balancing effect. Intense exercise causes a steeper increase in your heart rate than moderate exercise.

<p>Along with an increase in heart rate, the force of your heart's contractions also increases while exercising, so more blood is pumped with each beat. Aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health in general, but whether the impact varies with exercise intensity is not clear. The heart and lungs become more efficient as your cardiovascular training increases. This experiment was geared towards determining the pulse rate, heart rate, blood pressure level and the breathing rate of a student, during and after strenuous exercise activities.
