When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases. The added workload of exercise only increases the demands on your cardiovascular system. This process is measured by a term called “cardiac output,” which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute.</p>
