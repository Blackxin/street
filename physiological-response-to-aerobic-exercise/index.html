<p>The physiological response to exercise is dependent on the intensity, duration and frequency of the exercise as well as the environmental conditions. Exercise challenges many human physiological systems that need to adapt in order to maintain homeostasis, this is the inner balance of the body. The expectancy of an effect of fitness on the physiological stress response is based on the assumption that this response resembles the response to. Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism.

Aerobic literally means relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. The harder you work, the harder you heart needs to work. PPT TRAINING ADAPTATIONS PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID.</p>

<p>Aerobic exercise refers to the type of repetitive, structured physical activity that requires the body’s metabolic system to use oxygen to produce energy. Respiratory response to exercise • respiratory changes occur rapidly, even before the initiation of exercise. The physiological response to exercise is dependent on the intensity, duration and frequency of the exercise as well as the environmental conditions. Muscoskeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory responses to exercise through this unit as soon as you begin to exercise changes begin to happen within your body.

<p>During physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal of metabolites and carbon dioxide. The harder you work, the harder you heart needs to work. This response works to maintain an appropriate level of homeostasis for the increased demand in physical, metabolic, respiratory, and cardiovascular efforts.
