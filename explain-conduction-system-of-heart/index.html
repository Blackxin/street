The sinoatrial (sa) node (also referred to as the pacemaker of the heart) contracts, generating nerve impulses that travel throughout the heart wall. The sa node is located in the wall of the right atrium, inferior to the superior vena cava. Structure, function, and clinical implications, edited by wellens and associates, contains 37 items relating to the anatomy and electrophysiology of the heart.

<p>The conduction system of the heart is a collection of nodes and specialized cardiac muscle cells that initiate, conduct and distribute electrical impulses rapidly through the heart muscles. The san is found in the top of the right atrium. These muscle cells send signals to the rest of the heart muscle causing a contraction.

<p>The impulse is generated by the sinus node, in the upper region of the right atrium, and passed through preferential pathways to the av node, located at the base of the right atrium. The sinoatrial node, the heartâs pacemaker, initiates the heartbeat through sending an electrical impulse. The cardiac conduction system is the electrical pathway of the heart that leads to atrial and ventricular contraction. A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.
