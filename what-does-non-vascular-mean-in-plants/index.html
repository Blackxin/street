What Is A Nonvascular Plant Example slideshare From slidesharenow.blogspot.com
Vascular plant have xylem and phloem. They are generally small plants limited in size by poor transport methods for water, gases and other compounds. Vascular plants, such as trees and flowering plants most people think about, have vascular vessels to transport water and food throughout the. Vascular plants have vascular tissues, which circulate resources through the plant.
