What Is A Nonvascular Plant Example slideshare From slidesharenow.blogspot.com
Vascular plant have xylem and phloem. They are generally small plants limited in size by poor transport methods for water, gases and other compounds. Vascular plants, such as trees and flowering plants most people think about, have vascular vessels to transport water and food throughout the. Vascular plants have vascular tissues, which circulate resources through the plant.

<p>Vascular plants are also known as tracheophytes. Roots of the vascular plants absorb water passively in the absence of transpiration pull through osmosis. Vascular plants are plants found on land that have lignified tissues for conducting water and minerals throughout the body of the plant.
