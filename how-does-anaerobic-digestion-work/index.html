What is Anaerobic Digestion? Green City Times From greencitytimes.com
There are four main stages to this process: This happens in a sealed, oxygen free tank called an anaerobic digester. Though the phrase anaerobic digestion might sound like it describes a very complicated process… in many ways, it just does what it says on the tin. Anaerobic digestion is recognised by the government, defra, the welsh assembly, the scottish.
