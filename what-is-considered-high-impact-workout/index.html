Considered to be an advanced form of total body exercise, aerobics is a type of cardiovascular exercise that enhances muscle coordination, strength, and mobility. It’s important to stretch after a workout as that will help to prevent something called delayed onset muscle soreness. For example, walking is a weight bearing exercise that does not put extra strain on joints and is therefore deemed to be low impact. A high impact workout is any move that includes both feet off the ground at the same time, such as running, jumping, and plyometrics.
