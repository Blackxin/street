<p>This research is a literature review. Knowing the theory, we just learned, we can say that this system does not require oxygen to release energy (anaerobic) and does not lead to an accumulation of lactic acid (alactic). Certain circumstances require the body to produce energy faster than oxygen delivery can take place. Such pathways produce lactic acid, resulting in metabolic acidosis.
