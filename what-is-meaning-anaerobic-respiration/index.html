<p>It means, it conserves only 2.12 % of the total released energy in the usable form (atp energy). In higher organisms, aerobic processes take place when cells generate energy from the oxidation of organic molecules which is a process that releases large amounts. Oxygen is present when this form of respiration takes place. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.
