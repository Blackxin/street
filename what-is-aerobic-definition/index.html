<p>Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. Respiration is an important chemical process that releases the energy required for life processes. However, an aerobic environment may allow the growth of aerobic microorganisms, whose metabolic activities can influence the corrosion of metal. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy.</p>
