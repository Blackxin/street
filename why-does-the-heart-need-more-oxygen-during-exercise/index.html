Why Does Blood Pressure Increase During Exercise slideshare From slidesharenow.blogspot.com
The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. Clearly, an active body needs more oxygen than a body at rest. Oxygen intake increases as you exercise, since your heart is beating faster you will need more oxygen to resupply your body. This leads to increased fatigue resistance and a greater ability to exert yourself for longer periods.

<p>The heart responds to the increased demand by pumping more blood through the body—this increased flow of blood results in an increased heart. When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms). Oxygen intake increases as you exercise, since your heart is beating faster you will need more oxygen to resupply your body. Even when you halt your exercise, your heart rate does not return to normal.</p>
