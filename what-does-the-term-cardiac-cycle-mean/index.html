The cardiac cycle occurs in. It starts at the beginning of one heartbeat and ends at the beginning of another. One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive. There are two phases of the cardiac cycle:
