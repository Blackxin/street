<p>The heart rate increases during exercise. Both your pulse and breathing rate increase with exercise, maintaining a ratio of approximately 1 breath for every 4. Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute.

<p>In order to reap the benefits of exercise, your heart and breathing rates must increase. These gases are exchanged with the atmosphere when you breathe. Your muscles are working harder during exercise and that means their demand for oxygen. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.

<p>How does cardiovascular exercise affect your heart. At the beginning of exercise, your body removes the parasympathetic stimulation, which enables the heart rate to gradually increase. To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate.

<p>When you perform cardiovascular exercises, the entire blood flow becomes directed towards the working muscles, away from the regions that aren’t working much (like your digestive tract or arms). Aerobic workouts, especially swimming, train your body to use oxygen more efficiently, a practice that gradually reduces your resting heart rate and your breathing rate — two important indicators of cardiovascular health. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact.

Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute. These include decreased resting heart rate, improved ability to draw in deeper breaths, reduced resting blood pressure, increased calories burned to aid weight loss and reduced risk of heart disease. Ideas correlates to the results obtained, as with increasing elevation the heart rate increased from 88 beat/min to 104 beat/min at rest and the 19.8% to 18.0%, 147711.6ppm to 130739.6ppm, oxygen and carbon dioxide respectively, when condition had remained the same (pre exercise).
