<p>The heart rate increases during exercise. Both your pulse and breathing rate increase with exercise, maintaining a ratio of approximately 1 breath for every 4. Your breathing rate is measured in a similar manner, with an average resting rate of 12 to 20 breaths per minute. Your brain counters with an increase in heart rate, but if dehydration continues, heart rate will continually. Gas Exchange The Respiratory System Materials Exchange in the Body.</p>

<p>In order to reap the benefits of exercise, your heart and breathing rates must increase. These gases are exchanged with the atmosphere when you breathe. Your muscles are working harder during exercise and that means their demand for oxygen. Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles.

To test how much aerobic exercise raises the heat beat of a people, a person will take there resting heart rate, this is the heart rate of a person before doing any form of strenuous activity, for 1 minute using a stop watch, to make sure it is accurate.
