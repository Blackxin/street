<p>During exercise, efficient delivery of oxygen to working skeletal and cardiac muscles is vital for maintenance of atp production by aerobic mechanisms. Your blood carries nutrients to your muscle cells to create energy that your muscles need to contract. Aerobic exercise, also known as “cardio” exercise, uses repetitive contraction of large muscle groups to get your heart beating faster and is the most beneficial type of exercise for your cardiovascular system (your heart and blood vessels). During exercise, the job of the cardiovascular system is to deliver blood and oxygen from the heart and lungs to your working muscles. 143 best Heart Disease images on Pinterest Healthy heart, Heart.</p>
