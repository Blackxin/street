PPT Chapter 3 Increasing Cardiorespiratory Endurance PowerPoint From slideserve.com
The term “aerobic” is rooted from the latin word which means “with oxygen”. The well known exercise physiologist stephen seiler 2 has used an analogy referencing car engines in order to make a point on engine efficiency. Aerobic capacity is a more powerful predictor of mortality than any other established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular fitness is the capacity of the cardiovascular system (heart, lungs, and blood vessels) to supply oxygenated blood to working muscles.
