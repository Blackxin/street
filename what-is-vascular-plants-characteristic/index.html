Plant characteristics From slideshare.net
Characteristics of vascular plants 1. Vascular plants make up 80% of all plant species, including. Here you can learn more about the types of plant tissues , such as xylem and phloem. They differ from nonvascular plants, which do not have conducting tissues, and require water for fertilization.

<p>Vascular plants have vascular tissues which distribute resources through the plant. Vascular plant, also called tracheophyte, any of some 260,000 species of plants with vascular systems, including all of the conspicuous flora of earth today. Vascular tissue is an arrangement of multiple cell types in vascular plants which allows for the transport of water, minerals, and products of photosynthesis to be transported throughout the plant. Two kinds of vascular tissue occur in plants:</p>

The gametophyte is haploid, bearing only one set of chromosomes per cell. What are the characteristics of seed vascular plants?.seed vascular plants consist of gymnosperms and angiosperms.
