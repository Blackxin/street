<p>When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. Typically, doctors recommend an hdl level of 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood or higher. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ].
