Causes of Death in Patients Tested for Anticardiolipin Antibodies From researchgate.net
Cardiolipin antibodies target cardiolipins and hence lead to recurrent blood clots in veins and arteries. Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. Cardiolipin antibodies are frequently seen with autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), and with other antiphospholipid antibodies, such as. Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting.
