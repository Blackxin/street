Aerobic Capacity lesson 1 From slideshare.net
The individual’s aerobic capacity defines the size of the engine in a human being, much as in an automobile. The maximal amount of physiological work that an individual can do as measured by oxygen consumption. The ability to take in, transport and use oxygen to sustain prolonged periods of aerobic work. Sustained effort, without the need to increase the intensity of the exercise.

<p>Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. “aerobic capacity is the maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise,” explains trevor thieme, cscs, senior fitness. Recall that v̇o 2 always is equal to the product of the amount of blood delivered to all body. Aerobic Capacity lesson 1.</p>

While cardio training is most often associated with fat loss, it is also the best way to improve aerobic capacity, which is the ability to use oxygen to fuel exercise activity. Aerobic capacity is defined by the american college of sports medicine (acsm) as the ability to perform dynamic exercise that involves large muscle groups at a moderate to high intensity for prolonged periods.v̇o 2max is the most widely accepted measure of such aerobic capacity.
