Glucose &#43; oxygen → carbon dioxide &#43; water &#43; energy. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. All cells do cellular respiration, and there are two main forms, aerobic cellular respiration and anaerobic cellular respiration. More detailed differences between the two are as follows:

<p>The process in which organisms use oxygen to breathe and for breaking down fats and glucose into the chemical form of energy is called aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is important because it is the primary way that your cells produce energy. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.

<p>The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements. The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. Aerobic cellular respiration is the process of breaking down glucose to form intermittent electron electron carriers, which eventually donate their electrons to the final electron acceptor, oxygen, at the end of the electron transport chain. The use of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration is the primary distinction between anaerobic and aerobic respiration. PPT Respiration PowerPoint Presentation, free download ID1872216.</p>

<p>All cells do cellular respiration, and there are two main forms, aerobic cellular respiration and anaerobic cellular respiration. On the other hand, anaerobic bacteria, yeast cells, prokaryotes, and muscle cells perform anaerobic respiration. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. However, while aerobic respiration produces atp far more quickly and effectively than anaerobic respiration, human beings experience both.

<p>Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen. More detailed differences between the two are as follows: Aerobic respiration is the cellular respiration process that occurs in the presence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen during aerobic respiration allows for the production of large quantities of atp because oxygen is a superior electron acceptor to other elements.

<p>Living organisms use energy released by respiration for their life processes. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. It is a process when glucose is broken down to carbon dioxide in the presence of oxygen to produce energy in the form of atp. Anaerobic respiration occurs mostly in prokaryotes.
