Heart rate is a reflection of fitness relative to an individual’s activity level, cardiovascular efficiency, and muscular efficiency. To put it simply, “when your heart rate goes down, it means that each heart beat is more effective” (podcast 29: Cardio or strength training, which comes first? TuffStuff Fitness.</p>

<p>Hrv).a low resting heart rate is an indication of a strong heart muscle that can pump out a greater amount of blood with every beat so it does not have to beat as frequently. Your heart is a muscle and when it grows stronger through endurance training, it is able to pump more forcefully, pushing more volume of blood through the muscle per beat. The relationship between heart rate and fitness level is variable for individuals. The blood flow to the arms decreases slightly, and blood flow to the legs increases, sending nutrients to fuel the harder work. Changes in heart rate (HR) during exercise.
