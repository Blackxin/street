That’s nothing compared to what it can do when you call upon it to increase output during a workout. First of all, it can decrease blood pressure and cholesterol, leading to a lower risk of heart disease. In this context, recovery of the cardiovascular system after exercise occurs across a period of minutes to hours, during which many characteristics of the system, even how it is controlled, change over time. At the beginning of training, the heart rate increases and reaches the necessary equilibrium within a few minutes.
