<p>So, in the case of aerobic respiration, a larger amount of energy is produced as compared to anaerobic respiration process as complete oxidation takes place. However, in fermentation or anaerobic respiration there is net gain of only 2 molecules of atp from each glucose molecule, which is comparatively much less than that of aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration happens in the presence of oxygen and releases more energy than anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration takes place in the presence of free oxygen.
