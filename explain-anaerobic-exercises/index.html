<p>The body uses this oxygen to break down energy sources like fats and glucose to release energy we can use to perform the exercise. During the sprints, you don’t focus on breathing instead you try to run as fast as possible for a short duration. During aerobic exercise, you breathe faster and deeper than when your heart rate is at rest. Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure.
