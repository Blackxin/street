The cardiac cycle consists of the events in the heart from the start of one heartbeat to the start of the next. The diastole phase and the systole phase. During the entire cycle, pressure is maintained…. The heart’s primary function is to circulate blood throughout the body in a cycle.every day, the human heart beats around 100,000 times.

<p>Cardiac cycle is the process in which the blood gets pumped by the heart and gets delivered to the body organs and tissues by the blood vessels and returns back to the heart. It does so in a repeating sequence called the cardiac cycle. Each cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical stimulus in the sinus node and the consequent contraction of the atria and ends with the relaxation of the ventricles.

One during which the heart muscle relaxes and refills with blood, called diastole, following a period of robust contraction and pumping of blood, called systole.after emptying, the heart immediately relaxes and expands to receive.

<p>The cardiac cycle consists of the events in the heart from the start of one heartbeat to the start of the next. The filling of the ventricle (diastole) is followed by ventricular contraction (systole) to provide an adequate cardiac output during both rest and exercise to meet the body's metabolic demands. As the heart beats, it circulates blood through pulmonary and systemic circuits of the body. It is a period of relaxation of the heart chamber when refilling of the heart occurs.
