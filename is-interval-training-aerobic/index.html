Aerobic or cardiovascular training is designed to develop a healthier heart and circulatory system, says howard. As your cardiovascular fitness improves, you&#39;ll be able to exercise longer or with more. This method of training involves methodically weaving a short, extra intense burst of exercise intermittently throughout a regular cardio workout routine. Aerobic training should be done at least 3 times a week, at an intensity between 70% and 80% of their maximum heart rate, and normally goes for 30&#43;min in duration.
