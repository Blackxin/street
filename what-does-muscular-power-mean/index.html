Why you need both and how to measure them strength is force against resistance. Given the proper physical definitions and formulations involved in muscular power measurement, it is concluded that although strength (force output) and power (work/time) are quantitatively related, they remain separate physical parameters that can be measured in all dynamic muscular contractions, whether fast or slow. In this article we talk about the definition of muscular endurance.</p>
