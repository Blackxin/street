The target heart rate is extremely significant because it is at this level that you actually reach the stage where body starts utilizing fat as a fuel. The maximum rate is based on your age, as subtracted from 220. The Best Heart Rate To Burn Fat? Let's Talk About The &quot;FatBurning Zone&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, if you are 40 years old, your maximum heart rate would be 180 beats per minute. An average resting heart rate is between 60 to 100 beats a minute. The normal resting heart rate for adults over the age of 10 years, including older adults, is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Heart rate, also called pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. ZONING Cards 10 Pack 4x6 Cards.</p>
