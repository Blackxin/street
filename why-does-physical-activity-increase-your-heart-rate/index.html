<p>During exercise, your muscles have to work harder, which increases their demand for oxygen. Your heart rate rises and your pulse quickens, showing that your cardiovascular system is active. Fortunately, regular exercise is good at training. Because when exercising, muscles in our body need more oxygen during a heavy exertion, causing an increased breathing rate with a little bit of panting.

<p>Reasons behind increased heart rate when exercising. A single exercise session may protect the cardiovascular system for two to three hours, the authors postulate. This is because during a physical activity, our body needs almost four times our normal heart or cardiac output. The heart responds to the increased demand by pumping more blood through the body—this increased flow of blood results in an increased heart. Physical Exercise Physical Exercise Heart Rate.</p>

<p>Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. Some of the blood pumped by the heart travels to the lungs to get rid of carbon dioxide and pick up oxygen. They recommend getting at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise most days (or a total of about 150 minutes a week).
