The breathing rate and volume of each breath increases to bring more oxygen into the. Our bodies respond immediately to just one exercise session, but we see large adaptations to our bodies when we train consistently over time. Changes to one or more of the bodies systems as result of long term consistent stimulus, such as exercise. This can range from acute changes in cellular protein signals that regulate skeletal muscle.
