Aerobic means “with the presence of oxygen”. Aerobic exercise requires the heart and lungs to work harder to meet the body&#39;s increased oxygen demand. The adapted muscles have an easier time transporting and consuming oxygen molecules, providing the exerciser with improved endurance. Aerobic means requiring air , in which air usually means oxygen.
