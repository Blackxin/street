<p>Cellular respiration refers to the metabolic reactions at the cellular level that result in the breakdown of molecules from nutrients and the release of energy that is used to fuel cellular processes. Cell respiration usually occurs in the presence of oxygen (see aerobic respiration) but some organisms can respire without oxygen (see anaerobic respiration ). Cellular respiration is a critical function by which cells release energy for various cellular activities like locomotion, biosynthesis, and even the transportation of molecules between membranes. Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (atp), and then release waste products.
