BURN BELLY FAT IN 30 DAYS!! 10 min Cardio &#43; Ab Workout Week 1 Emi From readyfitz.com
Do this workout and burn up to 1000 calories. However, you’ll be used to it gradually. I do it for about 1 hour per day and i’ve been losing about 1 pound of fat per week. I find that going slower with higher resistance burns up to 250 more calories per hour than going faster with less resistance.
