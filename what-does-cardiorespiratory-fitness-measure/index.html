What is Cardiovascular Fitness? Medikoe From medikoe.com
The capacity of the circulatory and respiratory systems to provide oxygen to skeletal muscle mitochondria for energy synthesis during physical activity is referred to as cardiorespiratory fitness (crf). To classify cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), we measure maximum oxygen consumption (vo 2 max). Maximal oxygen consumption, or vo 2 max, measures the body’s maximum ability to take in and utilize oxygen, which directly correlates to overall health and fitness. However, these gas analyses systems are costly and take time to calibrate for each test.
