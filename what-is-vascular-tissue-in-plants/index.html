The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. Vascular plants contain vascular tissue composed of tubelike cells that transport food and water throughout the plant. These are components of the vascular tissue system in plants. A plant’s vascular tissues transport nutrients throughout the plant, just as the circulatory system transports nutrients throughout human bodies.

<p>The vascular tissues are xylem and phloem, and the combination of one xylem and one phloem adjacent to each other is called a vascular bundle. Vascular plants have xylem and phloem, special tissues that conduct water and food. The vascular plants are covered with a cuticle or waxy layer that holds in water. The elements of xylem and phloem have already been discussed in the. Botany 2Plant Vascular Tissue YouTube.</p>

<p>Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. Lower plants like algae, fungi and bryophytes lack vascular tissue. They typically occur together in vascular bundles in all plant organs, traversing roots, stems, and leaves. Phloem is the vascular system that carries food and water to parts of the plant.

<p>The plant vasculature is a sophisticated system that has greatly contributed to the evolution of land plants over the past few hundred million years. Dermal tissue, for example, is a simple tissue that covers the outer surface of the plant and controls gas exchange. Both are illustrated in the image below. One defining characteristic of the vascular plant is root, stem, and leaves. Vascular Tissue.</p>
