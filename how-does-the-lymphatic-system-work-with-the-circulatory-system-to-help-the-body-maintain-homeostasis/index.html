Circulatory System Homeostasis All About Home From karentsbogsite.blogspot.com
The lymphatic system is a part of the immune system as well. The lungs accomplish gas exchange by removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. The circulatory system maintains homeostasis, by the controlled and continuous flow of blood that reaches each cell in the body. Did you know the circulatory system comprises the heart, veins, capillaries.

<p>What are the three main functions of the lymphatic system? Your body regulates sugar levels to maintain homeostasis. The lungs accomplish gas exchange by removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. Your body ensures that the water content it contains does not become too concentrated or too dilated, and kidneys help in this case by getting rid of excess ions from the blood.
