<p>Forty five participants were randomly assigned to one of six exercise. The purpose of this study was to test if different intensities of aerobic exercise could influence abdominal fat, isoforms of bdnf and executive function. We included thirty egyptian ischemic stroke patients in the territory of anterior circulation. Thus, bdnf and cortisol may serve as. mBDNF (A) and proBDNF (B) values in acute exercise session in Week 1.</p>

(a) detected image of western blot. However, previous research investigating the use of resistance exercise to increase bdnf levels has been less conclusive, likely due to the low intensity nature of traditional resistance exercise.
