Aerotolerant anaerobes are the ones that do not need oxygen but survive even when oxygen is present but they cannot use oxygen in their metabolism. Anaerobic bacteria dies in the presence of oxygen, and therefore avoids o2. Aerobic bacteria offer much more energy to the cells than anaerobic bacteria.

You are probably aware of aerobic exercise (aka cardio) as an exercise that uses respiratory oxygen to generate the energy you need for your working muscles. Aerobic bacteria uses oxygen to oxidizes ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrate. An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment.

<p>The broad classification of bacteria as anaerobic, aerobic, or facultative is based on the types of reactions they employ to generate energy for growth and other activities. Anaerobic exercise, on the other hand, involves exercise that is not oxidative; Aerobic bacteria are much more efficient at making energy. This is the nitrogen cycle, or nitrification process, that most fishkeepers should be somewhat familiar with. PPT It’s a green world PowerPoint Presentation ID3997764.</p>
