This is created by the relationship between three things: Myocardiocytes are unique cells found in the heart that are able to independently. Broadly, the cardiac cycle passes through two phases: Each cardiac cycle begins with the generation of an electrical stimulus in the sinus node and the consequent contraction of the atria and ends with the relaxation of the ventricles.
