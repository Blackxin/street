Strength Training vs Cardio which is better? By Winnipeg Dietitian and From pinterest.com
If you don’t do the right amount of cardio, you will find yourself short of breath all the time and you won’t be able to keep performing at a high rate. Cardiovascular exercise, also called cardio or aerobic exercise, is exercise that increases your heart rate and makes your lungs work harder than normal. Strength training makes you stronger by building muscle endurance. When working out a fitness routine, there is a general misconception that cardio training is more efficient in burning fat while resistance training is solely focused on building muscle.however, cardio training and strength training are equally important for increasing endurance, building muscle, and maintaining a healthy body weight.
