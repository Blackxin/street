As a triathlete, i get 60 minutes or more of exercise 6 or 7 days a week, but i find i’m gaining weight anyway. I&#39;m under the assumption that 6 days a week at the gym as opposed to 3 will yield better results in terms of fat loss. On the other hand, 1 hour of aqua aerobics will only burn. Rest days are incredibly important for your body, particularly if it’s just getting used to exercise or if you’re seriously upping your efforts.
