Jeshma From slideshare.net
Aerobic activities they do not need a great physical effort, the most important thing is the duration of each one of them. Increases endurance, which means you can workout longer without getting tired. Physical capacity of athletes is an important element of success in sports achievements. Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are.

<p>Aerobic capacity is tested often while training road cyclists, swimmers, and rowers in order to assess cardiovascular fitness and to evaluate the training scheme. A simple method to measure this ability is to run as far as possible at an almost maximum rate. Maximum aerobic work capacity (vo2 max) is a clinical standard for measuring cardiorespiratory efficiency in graduated stages by increasing the duration and intensity levels where the gaseous exchange between oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide expulsion reaches the maximum threshold to sustain physical exertion.

<p>When the test is to cover a larger number of examinees at the same time or in a short period of time in field conditions, a step bench is the ergometer of choice. Your capacity for something is your ability to do it, or the amount of it that you are. The anaerobic capacity is the amount of energy that is obtained from anaerobic energy systems.

<p>A simple method to measure this ability is to run as far as possible at an almost maximum rate. It is determined by a combination of aging and cardiovascular conditioning and is associated with the efficiency of oxygen extraction from the tissue. With this in mind, which of the two should be prioritised is really a matter of what sport you play and the type of athlete you are. However, your body can only sustain this type of metabolism for a very short time, like 10 to 15 seconds. Effect Of Training On The Anaerobic Energy System.</p>
